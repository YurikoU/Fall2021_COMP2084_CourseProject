# Room In Search
Simple .NET Core application in C# using the MVC Scaffolding structure. This application is to search for a shared house. A user can review the existing posts to search a room. Once a user login, they can add a new post to look for a housemate.

# Purpose
It is pretty common for university or college students to live in a shared house once they live apart from their families. Indeed, I have lived in several shared houses in Canada so far and used websites to look for a new room every time. I have also seen some people tend to move to another house frequently. Hence, there are many prospective users to look for or rent out a room.
